# Router DOM Wrapper

> Author: Jimmy Lan

Router DOM wrapper is a thin layer around [React Router DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) to achieve easy configuration of permission-based routing.
The wrapper also provides utilities to configure routes using object-based configurations, but please note that object-based route configurations will be added back in [React Router DOM v6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom).
