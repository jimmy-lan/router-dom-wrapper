# React Permission Routing

> Author: Jimmy Lan

Permission Routing is a thin layer around [React Router DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) to achieve easy configuration of permission-based routing.
The library also provides utilities to configure routes using object-based configurations, but please note that object-based route configurations will be added back in [React Router DOM v6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom).

## Installation

Permission Routing can be installed via npm.

```bash
npm install --save @ly-public/router-dom-wrapper
```
Please ensure that you have the peer dependency installed:

```bash
npm install --save react-router-dom
```
